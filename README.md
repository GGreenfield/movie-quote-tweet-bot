# movie-quote-tweet-bot
Simple twitter bot which tweets out movie quotes from Napoleon Dynamite periodically.
This bot was created in April 2016. I had plans to expand the code to allow users to tweet @ 
the bot and the bot would reply with a random quote from the requested movie. I ultimately decided
not to further development on this bot as the method by which I was scraping imdb for quotes is against
the site's TOS(http://www.imdb.com/conditions). This was my first dive into the world of Twitter bots.
I might return to this to clean up the code as there are some small improvements that could be made.
